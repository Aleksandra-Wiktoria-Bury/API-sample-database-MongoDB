# Restaurants üßÜ

In this assignment you will be expected to write an API for connecting to a restaurant database

> Difficulty level: Advanced beginner üßô üçµ

## Keywords

`request parameters`, `query parameters`, `schemas`, `sample_restaurants`, `mongoose validation`, `routes`, `endpoints`, `patch`, `array of subdocuments`, `nested paths`, `lean`, `limit`, `findByIdAndUpdate`, `findByIdAndDelete`

## What you will be doing

For this assignment you will have to:

1. Load a sample dataset

This project assumes you've already had experience with:

- Express.js
- dotenv
- Setting up routes / endpoints
- Mongoose / MongoDB
- Schema subdocuments

## Tasks

## Task 1 - Loading the sample data

We will be using the `sample_restaurants` database.

## Task 2 - Setting up the .env file

## Task 3 - Connecting your server to your database

## Task 4 - Preparing our server to receive requests

## Task 5 - Restaurants Schema & Model

Unfortunately the sample datasets do not come with Models or Schemas, so we must build our own to interact with these databases / collections

1. Using the MongoDB viewing tool (or another similar tool), examine the data in the `restaurants` collection. What MongoDB data types are being used?

## Task 6 - Creating a search route

## Task 7 - Endpoint to search for restaurants by id

## Task 8 - Endpoint to search for restaurants by title

## Task 9 - Creating an update route

## Task 10 - Endpoint to search and update the restaurant name restaurant by id

## Task 11 - Endpoint to search and update the restaurant cuisine by id

## Task 12 - Endpoint to search and update the restaurant location by id

## Task 13 - Endpoint to search and update the restaurant grades by id

## Task 14 - Endpoint to search and delete restaurants by id
